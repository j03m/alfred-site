**Rank:** -2.47 | **Signal Strength:** 1.00

## Investment Thesis
I selected CCU for the portfolio primarily due to its exceptionally strong momentum signal, indicating a high likelihood of it becoming a top performer. This conviction is further bolstered by its robust performance across several key strategic metrics, suggesting a well-rounded investment profile that aligns with current market conditions.

## Factor Analysis
CCU demonstrates exceptional predicted future value, with both its monthly and quarterly value metrics scoring extremely high, signaling strong financial health ahead. Its current Price Velocity is also robust, confirming existing positive price momentum. Furthermore, the stock presents attractive cheapness relative to its fundamentals, suggesting its current valuation has not yet fully captured its intrinsic worth.

## Key Drivers
The predictive model did not highlight specific features as primary drivers for this selection. However, the overall strong performance across fundamental and valuation metrics, combined with the robust momentum signal, provides a confident basis for this inclusion.

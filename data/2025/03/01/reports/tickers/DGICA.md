## Investment Thesis
I have added DGICA to the portfolio because of its exceptionally strong momentum signal, indicating a high likelihood of it being a top performer. While its alignment with certain fundamental factors such as growth and valuation did not directly drive this decision, the stock's compelling market trajectory and predictive indicators are key to its inclusion.

DGICA stands out due to its remarkable **Trend Acceleration** and **Relative Strength**, as evidenced by its leading momentum signal. The analysis shows strong underlying predictive indicators for future value, suggesting robust potential. Although its performance in areas like growth, quality, and valuation did not align favorably with the portfolio's current specific factor preferences, the overwhelming market momentum positions DGICA as a strategic selection for capturing alpha in the current regime.

**Morning Brief: May 31, 2025**

## Market Regime
The current market environment is characterized by heightened volatility, as signaled by a rising VIX. My strategy is adapting to this regime by prioritizing predictive performance and specific valuation opportunities that tend to perform well amidst uncertainty.

## Macro Drivers
My investment decisions are being guided by key macro indicators. The increasing VIX, alongside supportive latent macro factors (PCA Factors 1 and 2), is strengthening my conviction in forward-looking predictive models and compelling valuations. While Bitcoin and oil prices are not currently acting as tailwinds for my core strategies, the prevailing volatility underscores the importance of the factors I am emphasizing.

## Strategy Outlook
My highest conviction lies with companies demonstrating robust forward-looking predictive performance, particularly on a monthly and quarterly basis. I also maintain a moderate emphasis on valuation, seeking opportunities that offer an attractive margin of safety. My current focus is weighted towards these predictive and valuation-driven segments, reflecting a strategic allocation designed to navigate the current volatile landscape.

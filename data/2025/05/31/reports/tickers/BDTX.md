## Investment Thesis
I selected BDTX for the portfolio due to its exceptionally strong momentum signal, indicating a high likelihood of it being a top performer. This robust upward price trajectory aligns well with the current market environment, suggesting strong investor conviction and potential for continued appreciation.

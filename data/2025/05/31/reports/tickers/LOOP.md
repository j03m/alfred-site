## Investment Thesis
I selected LOOP for the portfolio due to a confluence of robust forward-looking valuation signals and strong positive momentum. My analysis indicates that LOOP is currently trading at an attractive valuation, supported by solid growth prospects and sound fundamental quality. This fundamental strength, combined with a very high likelihood of continued outperformance, gives me confidence in its potential to generate significant alpha in the current market regime.

## Factor Analysis
LOOP's selection is primarily driven by its impressive valuation profile and considerable growth potential. I observed strong indicators across current and predicted future value metrics, suggesting it is fundamentally undervalued. This is complemented by a promising growth trajectory and solid fundamental quality, which together form a compelling investment case. Furthermore, the stock exhibits exceptional positive momentum, signaling a strong upward trend and a high probability of it being a top performer. While my predictive model did not highlight specific micro-features as distinct key drivers, the overall strength in its valuation, growth, quality, and momentum presents a robust picture for portfolio inclusion.

**Rank:** -3.77 | **Signal Strength:** 0.98

## Investment Thesis
I have selected LOOP for the portfolio primarily due to its exceptionally strong Momentum signal, which indicates a high likelihood of it being a top performer. While factors such as Quality, Growth, and Valuation do not appear to be the primary drivers of this specific selection, the stock's compelling trend acceleration and robust relative strength are the core of my investment thesis.

## Factor Analysis
My analysis shows that LOOP exhibits remarkable trend acceleration. Although fundamental metrics related to its Quality, Growth prospects, and current Valuation are not the leading contributors to this decision, the stock is demonstrating significant relative strength. This powerful upward momentum is the central reason for its inclusion, suggesting LOOP is well-positioned to capitalize on current market conditions and deliver outperformance.

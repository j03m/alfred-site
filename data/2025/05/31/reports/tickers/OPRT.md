## Investment Thesis
I selected OPRT for the portfolio due to its exceptionally strong momentum signal, indicating a high likelihood of top-tier performance. My analysis shows that OPRT presents a compelling combination of robust projected future profitability and an attractive current valuation. Supported by solid current operational strength and promising growth prospects, OPRT is well-positioned to perform well in the current market regime.

## Factor Analysis
The dominant factors driving the selection of OPRT are its exceptional projected future profitability, evidenced by strong forward-looking earnings potential, and its attractive current valuation. These metrics suggest the market has not yet fully recognized the stock's intrinsic value and future prospects. OPRT also exhibits strong current operational strength, reinforcing its fundamental stability and financial health. This potent combination of future earnings power and current undervaluation, amplified by its robust momentum, makes it a compelling addition to the portfolio.

**Rank:** -4.84 | **Signal Strength:** 0.98

## Investment Thesis
I selected TTI for the portfolio primarily due to its exceptionally strong momentum signal, indicating a high likelihood of it being a top performer. My analysis shows that its current upward trajectory is robust and expected to continue, making it a fitting addition to the portfolio, especially in a market regime that favors strong trending assets.

## Factor Analysis
TTI exhibits exceptional "Trend Acceleration," a powerful signal of sustained upward price movement, which is the primary reason for its selection. While the stock also displays strength in its "Alpha Profile" and "Relative Strength," these are direct reflections of its strong momentum. My analysis of TTI's fundamental value, growth trajectory, and quality metrics shows that these factors, despite being present, did not drive the decision to include it in the portfolio. The overwhelming momentum signal is the decisive factor in this selection.

## Investment Thesis
I selected TTI for the portfolio due to its exceptionally strong Alpha Profile, indicating a high probability of outperformance in the current market environment. This compelling momentum is supported by robust underlying fundamentals and attractive valuation metrics.

## Factor Analysis
My analysis reveals that TTI exhibits a highly attractive valuation profile. It demonstrates a strong predictive outlook for future profitability, with exceptionally high scores on both monthly and quarterly bases. The stock is also favorably valued based on its current metrics and presents significant undervaluation. While its growth potential and fundamental quality are more moderate, they are solid and do not detract from the overall positive investment case. The combination of exceptional price momentum and these strong valuation characteristics makes TTI a strategic addition that aligns well with our current market regime.

## Investment Thesis
I have selected WDC for the portfolio due to its exceptionally strong momentum signal. This indicates a high likelihood of it being a top performer, a crucial factor in capitalizing on current market trends. The powerful upward trajectory of WDC's price action aligns perfectly with the prevailing market regime, suggesting sustained upward potential.

## Factor Analysis
While the compelling momentum is the principal reason for adding WDC, my analysis of its strategic fit also reveals underlying strengths. The stock exhibits strong characteristics related to its future value predictions, both on a monthly and quarterly basis, and its current valuation. Additionally, WDC demonstrates solid growth prospects and maintains a good level of operational quality. Although these fundamental attributes were not the primary drivers that led to this particular selection, they serve to reinforce the conviction that WDC is a fundamentally sound company poised for continued positive performance.

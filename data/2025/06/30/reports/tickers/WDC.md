**Rank:** -5.56 | **Signal Strength:** 0.99

## Investment Thesis
I selected WDC for the portfolio because its exceptionally high momentum signal of 0.99 indicates a very strong likelihood of it being a top performer. This powerful upward trend suggests significant investor conviction and the potential for continued price appreciation, making it an attractive addition to the current portfolio strategy.

## Factor Analysis
My analysis indicates that WDC's inclusion is primarily driven by its exceptional market momentum, a signal of **Trend Acceleration**. While its current valuation attractiveness, growth prospects, and business quality metrics did not positively contribute to this decision, showing negative contributions within its strategic fit, the stock exhibits high underlying predictive scores for future valuation. Therefore, the decision was driven by its powerful upward trajectory and not by its current fundamental value or quality profile.

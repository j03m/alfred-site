## Market Regime
I am currently navigating a more cautious market environment. The rising VIX and headwinds for speculative assets like Bitcoin signal a clear shift away from risk-on appetite, prompting a strategic recalibration.

## Macro Drivers
My strategic adjustments are informed by these macro trends. The increasing volatility, coupled with signals from latent economic factors, is sharpening my focus on assets that offer stability and predictable performance. I am deemphasizing speculative momentum in favor of factors that reflect current value and underlying financial health.

## Strategy Outlook
In response, I am doubling down on companies exhibiting strong predicted future performance, drawing from both monthly and quarterly predictive models. Concurrently, I am increasing my emphasis on current valuation and fundamental quality, hunting for opportunities that provide a valuation guardrail against speculative volatility. My portfolio is being sculpted to favor resilience and attractively priced assets with robust forward-looking indicators.

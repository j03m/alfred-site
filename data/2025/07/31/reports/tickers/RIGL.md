## Investment Thesis
I selected RIGL for the portfolio primarily due to its exceptionally strong momentum signal. This indicates a high likelihood of it being a top performer in the current market environment, suggesting a powerful upward trend that I expect to continue. While RIGL does not align with traditional value or quality investment criteria, its current market trajectory is too compelling to ignore.

## Factor Analysis
My analysis indicates that RIGL's inclusion is not driven by traditional fundamental factors. It does not score favorably on metrics related to its current predictive value, predicted future value (both quarterly and monthly), growth prospects, or quality metrics. Similarly, the predictive model did not identify specific fundamental features supporting its selection. Instead, the decision is overwhelmingly based on its exceptional market momentum. This strong upward trend, often termed "Trend Acceleration," signifies robust investor interest and a prevailing positive market sentiment that I expect to sustain its performance.

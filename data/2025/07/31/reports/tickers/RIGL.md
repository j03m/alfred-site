**Rank:** -4.10 | **Signal Strength:** 0.99

## Investment Thesis
I've added RIGL to the portfolio because of its exceptionally strong Momentum Signal, indicating a very high likelihood of it being a top performer. This powerful indicator of upward price movement is the primary driver for its inclusion, suggesting RIGL is well-positioned for appreciation.

## Factor Analysis
RIGL's current profile presents a divergence from my portfolio's typical factor preferences. Its alignment with my established targets for value, financial health, and growth prospects is notably weak, as evidenced by negative contributions from these components. Specifically, the stock's present value assessment and its overall growth trajectory do not align with my portfolio's strategic factor weights. While the predictive model did not highlight specific bullish features for RIGL, its robust and accelerating trend signal indicates strong relative strength, driving the decision to include it.

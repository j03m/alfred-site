**Rank:** -4.10 | **Signal Strength:** 0.99

## Investment Thesis
I have selected RIGL for the portfolio because its exceptionally strong momentum signal indicates a high likelihood of outperformance. In the current market environment, pronounced trend acceleration is a critical indicator, and RIGL is demonstrating this powerfully.

## Factor Analysis
RIGL's inclusion is decisively driven by its robust momentum. My predictive model assigns a 0.99 probability that RIGL will be a top performer, signifying significant trend acceleration and strong investor conviction.

While RIGL does not currently exhibit strong alignment with traditional predictive valuation signals, current valuation metrics, growth potential, quality characteristics, or value propositions, its exceptional momentum is the overriding factor. This suggests that market dynamics are currently favoring RIGL's upward trajectory, superseding less favorable underlying factor exposures. In a regime where directional strength is paramount, RIGL's potent momentum is the key attribute I am leveraging.

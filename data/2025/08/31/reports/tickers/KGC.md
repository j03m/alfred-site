**Rank:** -3.94 | **Signal Strength:** 1.00

## Investment Thesis
I selected KGC for the portfolio because of its exceptionally strong momentum signal. My analysis indicates a 1.00 likelihood of it being a top performer, signaling robust upward price pressure and significant investor conviction in its current trajectory. This powerful Trend Acceleration is the primary driver for its inclusion.

## Factor Analysis
My selection of KGC is primarily driven by its exceptional momentum. While the stock does not currently score highly across traditional metrics such as current valuation or growth prospects, its robust upward price trend and significant investor interest are compelling. The predictive model's strong momentum signal, indicating a high probability of continued outperformance and significant Trend Acceleration, overrides the current weaknesses in other fundamental areas. Therefore, KGC's inclusion is a strategic play on its prevailing trend, aligning with market conditions that often favor strong, accelerating assets. The absence of specific key drivers from the predictive model means my confidence is anchored purely on the strength of its price action and its overall market sentiment.

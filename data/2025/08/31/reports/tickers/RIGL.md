**Rank:** -2.04 | **Signal Strength:** 1.00

## Investment Thesis
I have selected RIGL for the portfolio due to its exceptional momentum. The stock exhibits a near-perfect signal strength, indicating a very high likelihood of being a top performer. This strong trend acceleration suggests significant investor conviction and upward price momentum that I expect to continue.

## Factor Analysis
While RIGL does not currently align with our preferred factor profiles for growth, quality, valuation attractiveness, or its predicted valuations, its compelling momentum profile overrides these considerations in the current market environment. My analysis shows that RIGL is not a typical value or quality play based on its current financial metrics relative to our portfolio's established factor weights. The predictive model did not identify specific fundamental drivers as key contributors to this selection; instead, the decision is driven by its robust trend acceleration and strong likelihood of continued outperformance. This opportunistic selection leverages the current market regime, which favors strong trending assets.

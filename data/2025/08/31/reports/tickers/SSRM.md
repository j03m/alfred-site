**Rank:** -3.81 | **Signal Strength:** 0.99

## Investment Thesis
I selected SSRM for the portfolio primarily due to its exceptional momentum signal, indicating a very high likelihood of it outperforming the market. This strong trend acceleration suggests SSRM is poised for continued gains. While the stock also exhibits strong underlying fundamental characteristics, the compelling momentum is the primary driver behind my decision to add it to the portfolio.

## Factor Analysis
SSRM demonstrates robust fundamental metrics across its predicted quarterly and monthly valuations, current valuation, growth prospects, quality attributes, and current cheapness. Although these factors generally score very highly for SSRM, their specific contributions to my decision were not positive, indicating they are not the primary drivers for expecting price appreciation. Instead, the overwhelming momentum signal, supported by its strong "Alpha Profile" signifying superior relative strength, is the critical factor driving my outlook for continued upward movement.

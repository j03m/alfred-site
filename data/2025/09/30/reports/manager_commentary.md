# Alfred Morning Brief - 2025-09-30

## Market Regime
**Aggressive Momentum / Trend Following**
The model has shifted into a highly aggressive posture, overwhelmingly prioritizing price action over fundamental attributes. With **Monthly Momentum (9.38)** and **Quarterly Momentum (8.72)** holding the highest weights, the strategy is strictly adhering to the mantra "the trend is your friend." It is largely disregarding static fundamentals like **Quality (3.23)** and **Growth (3.57)**, suggesting a market environment where price discovery is driven more by flows and sentiment than by earnings reports or balance sheet strength.

## Macro Drivers
Bitcoin and Volatility (VIX) are acting as the primary divergent signals for this rotation:
*   **Bitcoin (Risk-On Proxy):** Acts as a split indicator. Positive crypto sentiment boosts the model's reliance on longer-term **Quarterly Momentum** and **Current Velocity**, signaling a standard "Risk-On" chase. Conversely, weakness in Bitcoin pushes the model toward **Monthly Momentum**, suggesting a fallback to shorter-term trend signals when speculative appetite wanes.
*   **Volatility (VIX):** The model has effectively hedged its momentum bet. While low volatility supports the Quarterly trend, the model increases its weight on **Monthly Momentum** when VIX rises. This implies the strategy is using the 1-month window as a stabilizer to navigate potential short-term turbulence or choppiness.

## Strategy Outlook
The model is actively hunting for **"Value on the Move."**
1.  **Price Strength is King:** Expect the portfolio to concentrate on names with strong 1-month and 3-month relative performance.
2.  **Valuation Anchor:** With **Cheapness (5.52)** as the third-highest factor, the model is avoiding pure speculative froth. It seeks stocks that are moving up but remain reasonably valued—likely rotating into cyclical value sectors that are catching a bid, rather than chasing overextended tech high-flyers.
3.  **Fundamental Agnosticism:** Low weights on Quality and Growth indicate the model will ignore "good companies" if their stock prices are languishing. Capital is allocated strictly to performance.

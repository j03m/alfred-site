## Morning Brief: September 30, 2025

**Market Regime**
I'm navigating a dynamic market where predictive power and valuation are paramount. While underlying sentiment, as indicated by assets like Bitcoin, often favors risk-on dynamics, my strategy is primarily driven by analytical signals rather than pure market exuberance. My approach is currently balanced, emphasizing predictive capabilities and attractive valuations, with growth as a secondary focus.

**Macro Drivers**
My conviction in forward-looking predictive models remains strong. Quarterly forecasts are performing well, supported by positive risk-on sentiment, which allows me to decrease exposure to market fear and commodity price inflation. Monthly predictive models are proving robust, demonstrating increased efficacy even amidst heightened market uncertainty. Current predictive signals and undervalued opportunities also benefit from this risk-on dynamic, though I remain cautious of commodity price pressures and specific negative latent macro states. My focus on quality characteristics is currently lower, though I note their increased appeal during periods of elevated market fear.

**Strategy Outlook**
Today, my strategic priority is to capture alpha through robust predictive modeling and attractive valuations. I am heavily emphasizing companies that my models identify with strong forward-looking potential, complemented by their current undervaluation. I am actively seeking growth opportunities that align with positive risk-on sentiment, but this is a secondary consideration to predictive power and value. While quality is not my primary focus, its resilience in uncertain macro environments is noted. My portfolio is being adjusted to favor positions that offer superior predictive alpha and value, while prudently reducing exposure to commodity price volatility and other headwinds.

## Market Regime
I have shifted the portfolio into a highly aggressive, tactical stance. My analysis indicates that immediate price dynamics are currently offering a far superior signal-to-noise ratio than traditional fundamental metrics. Consequently, I am significantly overweighting predictive price velocity models, effectively prioritizing "how stocks are moving" over "what stocks are."

## Macro Drivers
This pivot is driven by a divergence in macro signals that demands a multi-horizon approach. On the quarterly timeframe, strength in risk assets like Bitcoin has increased my conviction in a broader bullish trend, signaling a "Risk-On" environment. However, shorter-term signals—specifically interactions with the VIX—suggest that volatility remains a key variable. By heavily weighting my Monthly prediction model alongside the Quarterly one, I aim to capture the longer-term upside momentum while maintaining the agility to navigate near-term turbulence.

## Strategy Outlook
I am actively rotating capital into equities showing strong predictive momentum on both monthly and quarterly horizons. I have reduced exposure to the static 'Growth' and 'Quality' factors, as my models suggest these defensive characteristics are currently less predictive of near-term returns. Instead, I am using 'Cheapness' as a secondary valuation guardrail to ensure that while I chase momentum, I do not chase it into overvaluation. My primary focus is on catching the next leg of the trend identified by my predictive engines.

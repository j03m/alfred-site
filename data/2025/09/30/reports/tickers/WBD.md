**Rank:** N/A | **Signal Strength:** 0.99

## Investment Thesis
I have selected Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) for the portfolio primarily due to its exceptionally strong momentum signal, indicating a high probability of outperformance. My analysis reveals that WBD aligns remarkably well with our predictive models for intrinsic value, both currently and looking ahead, supported by high fundamental scores. This strong fundamental outlook, coupled with an attractive valuation, forms a compelling case for its inclusion in the current market environment.

## Factor Analysis
The dominant factor in my decision is WBD's robust momentum, reflected in a signal strength of 0.99. This suggests it possesses significant relative strength and is exhibiting accelerating price trends.

Beyond momentum, WBD's strategic fit is underpinned by strong predicted intrinsic value. My models indicate that WBD's forward-looking valuation metrics, both quarterly and monthly, score exceptionally high, suggesting a positive underlying trajectory. Its current fundamental valuation also scores robustly. Furthermore, the stock is trading at an attractive valuation, indicating it is currently undervalued relative to its potential. While specific predictive model drivers were not explicitly detailed, the confluence of powerful momentum and a fundamentally sound, attractively valued profile makes WBD a strong candidate for the portfolio in the current market regime.

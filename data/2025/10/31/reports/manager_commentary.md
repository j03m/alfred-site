## Market Regime
I am aggressively positioning the portfolio for a **High Momentum** regime, but with a distinct defensive undercurrent. My analysis indicates that while the broader trend remains constructive, the market is becoming bifurcated. I have decided to heavily overweight **Price Velocity** across both monthly and quarterly horizons, making it the absolute cornerstone of my strategy today. However, I am simultaneously deprioritizing pure "Growth" and "Quality" fundamentals, viewing them as currently less predictive than raw price action and valuation support.

## Macro Drivers
My risk models are flashing a complex signal that necessitates this dual-momentum approach. 
1.  **Divergent Risk Sentiment:** While speculative appetite (proxied by **Bitcoin**) continues to support longer-term (quarterly) trends, I observed it acting as a drag on shorter-term (monthly) momentum signals. This divergence has led me to prioritize the monthly horizon as my primary alpha source—seeking stocks that are moving independently of the crypto-speculative complex.
2.  **Volatility Awareness:** The **VIX** (market fear) has emerged as a positive driver for my defensive allocations. Its influence has compelled me to increase my exposure to **Value (Cheapness)** and shorter-term velocity, effectively using undervalued movers as a hedge against potential volatility spikes. I am using valuation as a guardrail rather than a primary engine.

## Strategy Outlook
Consequently, I am concentrating capital into names exhibiting **superior relative strength** over the last 1-3 months. I am largely ignoring "story stocks" (Growth) unless they are backed by immediate, hard price confirmation.

My hunting ground is specifically **"Value Momentum"**—stocks that are statistically cheap but are currently breaking out. This allows me to capture the upside of the prevailing trend while maintaining a margin of safety if the macro environment (Rates, Oil) exerts pressure on high-multiple equities. I am overweighting trend-followers and reducing exposure to stagnant quality names that lack immediate catalysts.

# Alfred Morning Brief - 2025-10-31

## Market Regime
**Aggressive Momentum (Risk-On).**
The model has adopted a decisive "Trend Following" stance, heavily overweighting Price Velocity predictions (**Pred_PV_M: 9.41**, **Pred_PV_Q: 8.71**) over fundamental factors. With **Quality (3.24)** and **Growth (3.57)** at the bottom of the priority list, the strategy is signaling that price action is currently the only signal that matters, disregarding balance sheet strength or earnings consistency in favor of raw price performance.

## Macro Drivers
**Crypto Sentiment & Volatility Divergence.**
*   **Bitcoin (Risk Proxy):** Acting as the dominant macro driver, Bitcoin is creating a sharp bifurcation in the strategy. It is the sole positive driver for **Quarterly Momentum**, suggesting that speculative risk appetite is supporting longer-term trend following. Conversely, it is actively suppressing weights on **Quality**, **Cheapness**, and **Monthly Momentum**, indicating that in this crypto-influenced environment, traditional valuation and shorter-term signals are viewed as noise.
*   **VIX (Fear Index):** While playing a secondary role, the VIX is exerting slight positive pressure on defensive factors (**Quality**, **Cheapness**) and **Monthly Momentum**, potentially hedging against the aggressive quarterly trend bet.

## Strategy Outlook
**Chasing Strength.**
The model is hunting for stocks with **strong predicted price velocity** over the next 1-3 months. It is effectively ignoring "value traps" (Cheapness) or "quality compounders" (Quality) unless they are already moving. Expect the portfolio to rotate into high-momentum names—likely volatile winners or breakouts—regardless of whether they appear expensive or fundamentally weak. The strategy is betting that the current trends are robust and will persist.

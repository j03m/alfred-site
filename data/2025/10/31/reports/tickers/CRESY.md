# Analysis: CRESY

**Rank:** -4.08 | **Momentum:** 0.98

## Investment Thesis

Cresud S.A.C.I.F. y A. (CRESY) has been selected primarily as a high-conviction **Momentum** play, exhibiting near-perfect alignment with the model's predictive price velocity indicators. The selection is driven by an exceptional technical setup where the stock scores virtually 1.0 on both Quarterly and Monthly predicted velocity measures. In a strategy that heavily weights predictive momentum (combined weight ~18.1), CRESY's ability to satisfy these criteria with almost zero penalty makes it a standout candidate. This is not a speculative "junk" rally, however; the thesis is underpinned by a robust Valuation (Cheapness) score, suggesting the market has not yet fully priced in the stock's trajectory relative to its fundamentals.

## Factor Analysis

The Manager model's selection is a function of minimizing deviation from ideal traits. CRESY excels where the model is most demanding:

*   **Momentum (Dominant Driver):** The quantitative signal is overwhelmingly bullish on price action.
    *   **Predicted Price Velocity (Quarterly & Monthly):** With raw scores of **1.00** and **0.98** respectively, CRESY is effectively the "perfect" momentum stock according to the Scout model's forecast. It incurs negligible penalty in these high-weight categories, anchoring its top-tier rank.
    *   **Current Price Velocity:** A raw score of **0.94** confirms that the trend is already in motion, validating the predictive signals.

*   **Value & Fundamentals (Supporting):**
    *   **Cheapness:** With a raw score of **0.83**, CRESY remains attractively valued despite its momentum. This provides a margin of safety, indicating the price run is supported by underlying asset value or earnings potential rather than pure hype.
    *   **Growth & Quality:** Scores of **0.71** (Growth) and **0.67** (Quality) are respectable but secondary. While they contribute the most to the negative score (due to deviations from perfection), they are well above average. The model accepts this "good, not great" fundamental profile because the momentum signal is so overpowering.

**Signal Strength:** 0.93

## Investment Thesis
I selected IRWD for the portfolio due to its exceptionally strong upward momentum and promising underlying value indicators. My analysis suggests IRWD is poised for continued outperformance in the current market environment.

## Factor Analysis
The primary driver for selecting IRWD is its exceptionally strong **Momentum Signal** of 0.93, indicating a high likelihood of it being a top performer. This significant upward trend is further supported by robust underlying fundamental signals.

My analysis of IRWD's **Strategic Fit** reveals promising aspects:
*   It shows a near-perfect alignment with its **predictive quarterly valuation**.
*   Its **predictive monthly valuation** and **current intrinsic value** are also notably strong, suggesting the stock is fundamentally sound.
*   IRWD presents an **attractive valuation**, indicating it is trading at a favorable price relative to its fundamentals.

While the company demonstrates good **growth potential** and solid **operational efficiency and financial health**, these factors are secondary to the overwhelming momentum and valuation signals in this particular selection. The model did not identify specific company-specific features from the Scout Model as key drivers for this decision.

## Outlook
IRWD fits the current market regime, which favors stocks exhibiting strong upward trends and attractive fundamental valuations. I am confident in its potential to contribute positively to the portfolio's performance.

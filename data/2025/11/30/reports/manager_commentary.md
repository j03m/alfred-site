## Market Regime
I have adopted a highly tactical, alpha-centric stance for this session. My analysis suggests that broad factor investing—simply holding "High Quality" or "High Growth" baskets—is currently suboptimal. Instead, I am heavily overweighting my proprietary predictive models, focusing on stock-specific dislocations rather than riding general market waves. I am prioritizing short-to-medium term price trajectory over long-term stability, signaling an aggressive hunt for immediate returns, tempered significantly by a preference for value over hype.

## Macro Drivers
Key macro inputs highlight a divergence in risk sentiment. Bitcoin’s recent activity has acted as a primary signal, serving as a bullish catalyst for my short-term monthly projections while simultaneously flagging caution for the quarterly outlook. This suggests a liquidity-driven rally that may not be sustainable over longer horizons. Furthermore, rather than retreating from rising volatility (VIX), I am interpreting it as a mechanism that creates mispricing. Falling oil prices are also reinforcing my conviction in specific sectors, likely by alleviating input cost pressures for the targets I am selecting.

## Strategy Outlook
To capitalize on this regime, I am decisively rotating away from expensive "Growth" and premium "Quality" names, which currently appear overcrowded. My primary fundamental focus is now on "Cheapness." I am hunting for undervalued assets where the recent volatility has created an unjustified discount, providing a margin of safety. By combining this valuation discipline with my strongest short-term predictive signals, I aim to capture rapid mean-reversion and momentum shifts while avoiding the valuation risks inherent in the broader market's high-flyers.

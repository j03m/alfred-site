## Market Regime
My current stance is one of selective engagement, prioritizing assets with strong predictive signals and attractive valuations. While the positive influence of Bitcoin suggests a leaning towards risk-on environments, the complex signals from market volatility indicate that I am actively seeking opportunities that emerge even within periods of heightened uncertainty. I am focused on identifying companies that my models suggest will outperform, rather than simply chasing broad market growth or defensive qualities at this time.

## Macro Drivers
The positive correlation between Bitcoin and my key predictive performance indicators reinforces my conviction in seeking out assets with strong forward-looking potential. Concurrently, I'm noting that periods of increased market fear, as measured by VIX, appear to be strengthening my focus on shorter-term predictive signals and current valuation. This suggests an environment where volatility itself may be creating opportunities for my predictive models. Furthermore, declining oil prices are acting as a tailwind, supporting my emphasis on current valuation and future performance metrics.

## Strategy Outlook
My strategy today is centered on a strong conviction in assets exhibiting robust predictive performance and compelling cheapness. I am actively rotating into opportunities where my models signal superior future potential and where current valuations provide a margin of safety. While growth opportunities and high-quality companies remain important considerations, my primary focus is on those companies that my predictive framework identifies as most promising for outperformance in the current market dynamic.

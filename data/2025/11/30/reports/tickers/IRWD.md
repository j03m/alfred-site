**Rank:** -3.20 | **Signal Strength:** 0.97

## Investment Thesis
I have selected IRWD for the portfolio primarily due to its exceptionally strong momentum signal, indicating a high likelihood (0.97) of it being a top performer. While its fundamental metrics are robust, the current market dynamics suggest its price action is the most compelling reason for inclusion at this time. I anticipate continued positive price movement driven by this observable market strength.

## Factor Analysis
IRWD presents a compelling combination of fundamental strength and market momentum. My analysis indicates exceptionally high current and future valuation expectations, a solid growth profile, and a commendable level of business quality. The stock also offers an attractive value proposition, scoring highly on cheapness.

However, these individual factors did not primarily drive the decision to add IRWD to the portfolio. Instead, its powerful momentum signal—a strong indicator of relative strength and trend acceleration—is the dominant factor. The predictive model does not identify specific individual features as key drivers for this stock, suggesting that its outperformance is a holistic outcome rather than being tied to a few singular attributes. The strong foundational scores across valuation, growth, quality, and cheapness provide a supportive backdrop for the significant momentum I am observing, reinforcing my confidence in this selection.

# Alfred Morning Brief - 2025-12-01

## Market Regime
**Strong Risk-On / Momentum Dominant**

The model has shifted into a decisive Risk-On posture. With a combined **80% weight allocated to Price Velocity (Momentum)** across quarterly (`Pred_PV_Q`: 40%) and monthly (`Pred_PV_M`: 30%) horizons, the strategy is aggressively prioritizing price action and trend strength. Traditional safety nets—Fundamentals (`Quality`) and Valuation (`Cheapness`)—have been reduced to minimal stabilizing roles (5% each), indicating a market environment where "the trend is your friend" and defensive attributes are currently less rewarded.

## Macro Drivers
The strategy's aggressive pivot to Momentum is driven by strong signal efficacy in the quarterly and monthly timeframes. However, this conviction is nuanced.

*   **Headwinds to Conviction:** The primary macro variable moderating our stance is **Inflation (CPI)**. Analysis shows `Inflation_CPI` exerting a negative impact (-0.5) on our top factor, Quarterly Price Velocity. This suggests that while momentum is the most attractive factor, lingering inflationary pressures are acting as a drag, preventing an even more extreme concentration. The model is effectively "climbing the wall of worry"—betting on trends while acknowledging the macroeconomic friction.

## Strategy Outlook
**Hunting High-Velocity Movers**

Based on the current weightings, Alfred is rotating capital into stocks exhibiting **raw speed and acceleration**:
*   **Focus:** Identifying "High Flyers"—equities with established, accelerating uptrends over the last 3-month and 1-month windows.
*   **De-emphasis:** The low weights on `Quality` and `Cheapness` imply a willingness to overlook stretched valuations or weaker balance sheets in the short term to capture alpha from price persistence.
*   **Action:** Expect the portfolio to favor sectors with strong relative strength, potentially increasing beta, as we chase the prevailing market velocity.

## Market Regime
I have firmly positioned the portfolio for a **Risk-On** environment. The market is currently rewarding strength, and I have decided to align aggressively with this behavior. I am betting on trend continuation rather than mean reversion, maintaining a high conviction that today's winners will continue to outperform in the near term.

## Macro Drivers
While my posture is aggressive, it is not reckless. My analysis highlights **Inflation (CPI)** as a persistent headwind. Specifically, inflationary signals are acting as a drag on my conviction in longer-term quarterly trends, tempering what would otherwise be a maximum-exposure stance. I am monitoring this friction closely; while it hasn't pushed me into a defensive crouch, it forces me to be more selective with my momentum entries than I might be in a perfect "Goldilocks" scenario.

## Strategy Outlook
My strategy today is unequivocal: **Follow the Trend**.
*   **Primary Focus:** I am heavily overweight **Medium-Term Momentum**. I am hunting for stocks that have established clear price leadership over the last quarter and month. If a stock is moving, I want to be involved.
*   **Secondary Filters:** I am utilizing **Growth** metrics as a "tie-breaker" to validate these price moves, ensuring there is fundamental fuel behind the rally.
*   **What I'm Avoiding:** I have significantly reduced exposure to **Value (Cheapness)** and defensive **Quality** factors. In this regime, I view "cheap" stocks as value traps and defensive plays as a drag on performance. I am not looking for bargains; I am looking for velocity.

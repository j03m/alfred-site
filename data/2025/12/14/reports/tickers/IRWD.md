**Signal Strength:** 0.97

## Investment Thesis
I have selected IRWD for the portfolio due to its exceptionally strong momentum signal, which indicates a high probability of it becoming a top performer. My analysis shows that IRWD is currently exhibiting powerful "Trend Acceleration," suggesting that prevailing market sentiment and investor conviction are driving its price forward, even though it does not align with traditional quantitative factor profiles.

## Factor Analysis
IRWD's traditional quantitative profile, encompassing metrics related to its predicted future value (both quarterly and monthly), current valuation, growth prospects, fundamental quality, and overall cheapness, does not strongly support its inclusion. The model indicates negative contributions across these dimensions, suggesting IRWD does not currently excel in these areas. However, its exceptional "Momentum Signal" of 0.97 signifies robust "Trend Acceleration." This strong forward-looking momentum is the primary driver for its selection, indicating that the stock is likely to outperform due to current market dynamics and investor interest, rather than traditional fundamental strengths.

# Morning Brief: June 1, 2025

## Market Regime
Good morning! As we kick off June, I’ve taken a good look at the current market environment, and I feel it's leaning towards a **Risk-Off** sentiment. With growth indicators showing some volatility and uncertainty, I am favoring higher-quality investments that can offer stability in these choppy waters. It’s important to be prudent, especially now, as the tug between risk appetite and caution is front and center.

## Macro Drivers
Several macro indicators have shaped my perspective today. The **VIX**, which represents market fear, remains elevated, suggesting that investors are skittish. This elevated fear level usually prompts me to prefer more stable, quality-focused investments as a guardrail against unpredictable volatility. Additionally, the **10-Year Treasury Yield** has seen fluctuations, hinting that fixed income might become more attractive against equities if the volatility persists. 

Bitcoin's performance has been intriguing, but it seems to signal a more cautious approach lately, so I will be reducing exposure to more speculative assets. The oil price has dipped modestly, which typically aligns with broader economic concerns, leading me further towards a more defensive stance. 

## Strategy Outlook
Given these insights, I am **rotating into quality stocks**, particularly those that exhibit strong balance sheets and reliable earnings. I’m also eyeing sectors that tend to outperform during risk-off periods, like utilities and consumer staples. My focus today is on companies with solid fundamentals—those that can weather the storm when investors are feeling jittery.

I will be **reducing exposure** to high-growth stocks and speculative plays that may present higher risks. By prioritizing value and quality, I’m aiming to create a portfolio that can not only survive but thrive, even when the markets are behaving unpredictably.

Let’s keep our eyes on the horizon and navigate these waters together!

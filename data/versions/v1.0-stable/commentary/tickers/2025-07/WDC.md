## Sizing & Conviction
I have decided to put **Western Digital Corporation (WDC)** in a satellite position within the portfolio, currently allocating no capital at 0.0%. This is not indicative of a lack of conviction; rather, it's a strategic choice to ensure diversification while I keep a close eye on its trajectory. By holding a satellite position, I can take advantage of its growth potential without overly exposing the portfolio to any associated risks. This allows me to pivot into WDC when conditions are optimal, making it a nimble addition to my investment landscape.

## The Macro-Micro Thesis
With a focus on the current market context, my analysis highlights a positive backdrop for WDC, chiefly due to its alignment with macroeconomic factors that favor its niche. The interest in Bitcoin is consistently rising, generating a growing demand for data storage solutions, which plays right into WDC's strengths in flash memory and storage devices. Though the VIX has shown some negative movement, indicating investor nervousness, my conviction remains strong due to several positive micro drivers that define WDC's fundamentals.

Looking into the details, the stock’s recent performance against moving averages indicates a robust market presence, which I find incredibly encouraging. Furthermore, WDC's year-over-year gross profit growth showcases its potential to maintain profit margins amid fierce competition. The combination of strong absolute rankings over the last decade and impressive net profit margins fortifies my belief that WDC is sitting on solid ground.

The current macro environment, fraught with volatility indicators, can shake investor confidence, but it can also present incredible buying opportunities for undervalued stocks like WDC. Thus, although I’m keeping my allocation light for now, the potential for a strategic move into WDC remains firmly on my radar.

## Risk Assessment (Pre-Mortem)
As with any investment, it’s crucial to acknowledge the risks that could derail WDC's upward momentum. The declining metrics surrounding indices like SPY and factors like delta_SPY show a negative influence that could affect overall sentiment and might cause some selling pressure on stocks like WDC, especially if market conditions worsen. Additionally, if the broader economic picture deteriorates, it could limit consumer spending, which would also have implications for WDC's sales revenue.

I must also consider the potential negative impacts from liabilities and other current pressures that could affect operational cash flows and investment capabilities. While my excitement about WDC's future prospects remains high, I should be prepared for the chance that these market realities could present headwinds.

In summary, my decision to hold WDC in a satellite position reflects a thoughtful balancing act—leveraging its strong growth signals while being cautious of the surrounding macroeconomic volatility. I look forward to watching how this play unfolds and may adjust my position as the landscape evolves.

## Market Regime

I see us entering a **Risk-On** phase as we move into June 2025. With the recent surge in market momentum and a brighter economic outlook, I’m feeling optimistic. Stocks are showing signs of high velocity, with growth indicators seeming to pick up pace. Overall, the market is displaying a strong appetite for risk, and I’m adjusting my strategy accordingly. 

## Macro Drivers

Several key macro factors are influencing my current strategy. The **VIX**, which signals market fear, has been declining, suggesting that investors are feeling more confident. This supports my inclination to increase exposure to growth assets. 

Additionally, the **10-Year US Treasury Yield** remains relatively stable, which typically signals a good environment for equities. On the flip side, I’ve noticed that **Bitcoin** prices have been under pressure—an indicator of waning risk-on sentiment among crypto enthusiasts, which could pull some speculative energy away from more traditional markets.

Furthermore, the analysis of options market activity tells me that the underlying sentiment is shifting. The options open interest is on the rise, hinting at increased bullishness, which I see as a solid signal for rotation into more growth-oriented investments.

## Strategy Outlook

Today, I’m focusing heavily on **growth and quality stocks**. My analysis has led me to prioritize companies that are not only exhibiting strong growth potential but are also backed by solid fundamentals. I’m on the lookout for undervalued movers that can capitalize on this momentum. Specifically, I’m leaning into sectors that show a balance of quality and reasonable valuations—like tech and clean energy—where I believe the mix of growth and value can thrive.

In terms of style, I’m heavily overweighting companies that demonstrate strong momentum while ensuring that my investments have a value cushion to protect against any potential volatility. This approach aligns with my current conviction, aiming for a portfolio that can harness the best of both worlds: growth potential and a bit of defensive strategy.

So, in essence, I’m feeling confident but cautious—balancing my growth ambitions with a watchful eye on the market's twists and turns! Let’s ride this wave together! 🎉

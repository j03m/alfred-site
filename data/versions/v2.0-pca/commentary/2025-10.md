## Morning Brief - October 1, 2025

### Market Regime
I’m feeling decidedly Risk-On this morning! The momentum is shifting positively, and I'm sensing a bit of growth enthusiasm bubbling up in the markets. With the overall velocity in the S&P signaling high potential for price gains, I'm excited about what could come next. My focus today is on capitalizing on sectors that can thrive when investors are feeling confident and ready to take on some risk. 

### Macro Drivers
Several macro indicators are shaping my strategy today. The fear gauge—known as the VIX—is showing signs of easing, which makes me more comfortable leaning into growth strategies. The 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield continues to reflect upward pressure, suggesting that investors might be inching back toward equities for better returns. However, there are some headwinds; Bitcoin has taken a hit recently, which generally tempers the risk-on sentiment. Still, the outlook is positive, with signs of increasing market activity supporting my decision to focus more on sectors poised for growth. 

In terms of what's driving me, the increase in market open interest suggests a greater appetite for options, signifying investor confidence. Coupled with strong market net gamma readings, this points to further price stability and upward movements in the near term.

### Strategy Outlook
With this backdrop, I am heavily prioritizing stocks that show strong growth potential. I’m on the lookout for quality companies that aren’t just sitting still; I want businesses that are innovating, adapting, and showing solid earnings growth. My analysis suggests favoring firms that are undervalued—this gives me a cushion against potential market volatility.

Additionally, I'm putting some distance between my portfolio and assets that lean heavily on speculative trading, particularly lower-performing sectors. Instead, I’m focusing on boosting positions in sectors such as technology and consumer discretionary, which are likely to benefit the most from heightened consumer spending and broader economic recovery.

In summary, I'm prioritizing growth-oriented equities while carefully navigating around the more volatile bets. That way, I’m setting myself—and you—up for potential success in a fluctuating market. Together, let’s make some smart moves today!

## Sizing & Conviction

I have decided to make **OSCR** a core holding in my portfolio, giving it a prominent allocation of close to 10%. This is not merely a casual choice; I see **OSCR** as a high-conviction bet in the current market landscape. The main reason for this enthusiasm stems from its "Cheapness" appeal, which aligns perfectly with my strategy to prioritize undervalued companies that show signs of being solid long-term investments. With this allocation, I’m comfortable taking a robust stance, confident that the valuation will provide a safety net against market whims.

## The Macro-Micro Thesis

The broader economic backdrop is quite compelling for a “Cheapness” strategy. The market is currently characterized by fluctuations that have created opportunities among undervalued stocks like **OSCR**. On one hand, there's a significant uptick in market options interest, which signals potential investor confidence. On the other, factors such as declining overall trading volume and pressures from Bitcoin volatility create an environment where undervalued stocks can shine – and that's where **OSCR** comes into play.

The micro drivers behind **OSCR’s** appeal are equally promising. The metrics indicate positive contributions from various factors, suggesting a potential for solid returns. Notable movements like strong daily returns and favorable absolute rank changes indicate that **OSCR** is well-positioned to capitalize on any shifts in sentiment. All these positive signals point toward a robust operational foundation – exactly what I cherish in my investments when looking at long-term growth.

Now, let’s bridge that macro backdrop with the micro specifics: while the broader market may have its uncertainties, **OSCR’s** fundamental strengths provide a hedge against these concerns. The focus on value plays gives a sense of security, even as market dynamics fluctuate.

## Risk Assessment (Pre-Mortem)

However, every investment comes with its risks, and **OSCR** is no exception. I need to keep a watchful eye on the micro risks that might jeopardize this promising position. For instance, contributions coming from certain factors aren't as favorable, particularly aspects related to profitability. A downward shift in return metrics can signal instability, and the negative impacts from the dividend factor are noteworthy as dividends can reflect financial health.

In a worst-case scenario, if the company’s returns flare up negatively due to operational inefficiencies or unexpected market reactions, I could face a significant impact on my investment thesis. Consequently, I’m committed to monitoring these factors closely, staying informed through regular analysis to gauge both the health of **OSCR** and the broader market.

As I navigate this investment landscape, my approach with **OSCR** is not just about looking for immediate returns; it's about staying grounded, understanding where the company stands and keeping a pulse on its performance relative to market changes. With a clear plan, I believe that **OSCR** can be a shining star within my portfolio for years to come.

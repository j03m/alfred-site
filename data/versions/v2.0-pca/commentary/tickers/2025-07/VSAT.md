# Why I Chose VSAT for the Portfolio

**Rank:** -7.55 | **Signal:** 0.89 | **Type:** High Velocity Compounder (Top Tier Signal across horizons)

## Sizing & Conviction

I've decided to allocate a core holding of about 5.9% to VSAT in our portfolio. This is not just a casual pick; I view it as a strong conviction bet positioned to capitalize on its current growth trajectory. By targeting this percentage, I'm ensuring that VSAT has a significant presence in our portfolio, allowing us to reap the benefits of its high velocity compounder status while still maintaining diversification across other assets. This level of investment reflects my belief in the stock’s potential to generate impressive returns over time, especially given its positive macro and micro economic indicators.

## The Macro-Micro Thesis

In choosing to focus on VSAT, I’m heavily leaning into its Curr_PV profile, which aligns beautifully with the broader macro context. The current market landscape is exhibiting some interesting characteristics. Specifically, indicators such as increased market optimization suggest that investor interest is on the rise and is likely pushing demand for tech-based solutions, where VSAT operates. Although some headwinds exist — notably, declining trading volume and Bitcoin fluctuations — the positive macro aspects mitigate these risks.

On the micro level, I am particularly impressed by VSAT’s ability to grow its dividend payouts year-over-year and the solid uptick in insider buying activity, which indicates that those closest to the company have faith in its future. These features signal a positive outlook for the company's financial health. Notably, the growth in payout percentage can give investors an additional layer of security, reinforcing my conviction that VSAT will weather any storm effectively.

Furthermore, the stock's robust performance over various rolling periods, as indicated by its strong relative ranks against moving averages, adds to my confidence. This consistency highlights that VSAT maintains strong market interest, reinforcing that its fundamentals are indeed sound during a time where sentiment might be shakier.

## Risk Assessment (Pre-Mortem)

While I'm excited about what VSAT brings to the table, I’m not ignoring the potential pitfalls that could arise. A few features are causing me some concern, acting as micro risks that could impact our investment's performance.

1. **Dividend Fluctuations:** Concerns about the size and consistency of dividend payouts may introduce volatility. If the payout were to decrease, it could signal underlying issues that shake investor confidence.
   
2. **Mixed Returns:** Indicators like PCA returns show some inconsistent performance relative to the broader market. If this trend continues, it may raise red flags about the company’s overall stability and ability to deliver expected growth.

3. **Overall Market Sensitivity:** Given the macroeconomic factors at play, even solid companies like VSAT are susceptible to broader market downturns. The current environment, especially with the backdrop of rising interest rates and fluctuations in cryptocurrency, could spark unwanted sell-offs.

Taking these factors into account, strategy becomes paramount. My approach is to maintain a keen eye on these drivers and be ready to adjust my exposure if necessary. Regular monitoring will be key, allowing us to take informed action quickly if circumstances shift.

Ultimately, my decision to incorporate VSAT into our portfolio is underpinned by a strong belief in its potential to harness growth opportunities while providing a cushion against unpredictable market movements. As we navigate our investment journey, my focus will be on leveraging these insights for both prosperity and protection.

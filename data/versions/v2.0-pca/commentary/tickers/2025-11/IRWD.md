## Sizing & Conviction
I have decided to include IRWD as a core holding in the portfolio, representing a significant commitment at 16.5%. This decision reflects my strong conviction in its potential to deliver value. By designating it as a core holding, I'm betting on IRWD's capacity for sustainable growth and profitability over the long haul. Given its positioning as a high-velocity compounder, I believe it can contribute markedly to my portfolio's overall performance, especially in the current market environment where cheapness is primed to shine.

## The Macro-Micro Thesis
My analysis suggests that IRWD is particularly compelling right now because of the broader economic backdrop, which favors cheapness in stock selection. With indicators pointing towards a positive market outlook, IRWD fits snugly within this narrative. The increases in market options open interest and net gamma mean that investor sentiment is leaning on the optimistic side, creating an ideal setting for undervalued stocks to potentially surge.

On the micro level, several factors contribute positively to IRWD's profile. Its lower daily volatility suggests stability, while substantial returns from recent growth metrics highlight its potential for strong performance. Furthermore, the stock’s ratio of its performance against the market indicates that it's undervalued, appealing to my strategy of favoring stocks with attractive valuations.

However, it’s essential to keep in mind that the company does face several risks. For instance, while it shows great potential, its current dividend yields may be less attractive, which can deter certain investors. Additionally, relative margins and profit rankings are flagged as concerns; these could indicate operational challenges that need addressing. Yet, the positive attributes far outweigh these risks at this moment, making IRWD a standout choice.

## Risk Assessment (Pre-Mortem)
Despite IRWD’s promising outlook, I need to be cautious about the potential pitfalls that could affect its performance. The absence of substantial dividend payouts may not sit well with income-focused investors, which could lead to selling pressure if the stock doesn’t perform as expected. Similarly, the concerns around profit margins could signal a more challenging operational environment, where the company struggles to convert revenue into actual profit. Lastly, any dips in market sentiment could amplify the negative impact from these areas, leading to volatility. 

However, my strategy remains centered on the understanding that the positive momentum in various metrics, along with the overall market tendency towards cheapness, offers a solid buffer against some of these risks. Thus, I feel confident in my commitment to IRWD as I navigate the investment landscape.

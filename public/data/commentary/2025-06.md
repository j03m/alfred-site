## Market Regime
The market is a bit of a mixed bag right now! While I see encouraging signs like Bitcoin's strength, there's also a cautious undercurrent that my models are picking up on. Factors like rising oil prices and increased market volatility are signaling a more tempered environment, nudging my shorter-term outlook towards caution.

## Macro Drivers
I've been keeping a close eye on a few key market signals. While Bitcoin's positive trend suggests some investor appetite for risk, other indicators like rising oil prices and a jump in market volatility (that's what the VIX tells me) are prompting my shorter-term predictive models to signal a need for careful navigation. These factors are leading me to be more selective, rather than just chasing speculative growth. My longer-term quarterly outlook, however, still sees potential, supported by Bitcoin's strength and a generally more stable VIX, allowing me to balance short-term caution with a view on longer-term opportunities.

## Strategy Outlook
My main game plan is to focus on identifying companies with strong *predictive value*. Given the current mixed environment, I'm not heavily chasing speculative growth right now, nor am I solely hunkering down in the safest assets. Instead, I'm prioritizing businesses that my models pinpoint as having robust potential for the future, looking out over both monthly and quarterly horizons. I'm seeking out companies that can demonstrate resilience through uncertain times, while also being perfectly positioned to capitalize on any emerging market upswing. My aim is to identify that sweet spot where underlying strength meets future promise.

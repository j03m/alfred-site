## Market Regime
Good morning! As we dive into September 2025, I’m stepping into a more cautious space, signifying a Risk-Off regime. Recent market movements have suggested an increasing sense of unease, with volatility indicators like the VIX slightly nudging up. This shift has led me to strengthen my focus on quality and defensiveness rather than chasing after high-growth opportunities. While I do believe growth has exciting potential, I’m prioritizing stability for now, especially as we navigate through these unpredictable waters.

## Macro Drivers
The macroeconomic signals are providing some intriguing insights. The VIX, or market fear gauge, has been oscillating, which often signals heightened anxiety among investors. I've noticed that while Bitcoin has been losing some steam (which generally correlates with a risk-on sentiment), the stubbornness of its decline suggests a waiting period for the market to stabilize. On top of that, the oil prices have trended downward, creating further uncertainty about economic robustness and fueling this cautious stance.

The spread between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields is also a concerning indicator; it's been flattening, hinting at possible recession fears ahead. With these indicators at play, I believe it's wise to reinforce a strategy that emphasizes quality and cheapness—seeking resilient stocks that can weather potential downturns.

## Strategy Outlook
Today, I’m on the hunt for companies that exhibit strong fundamentals and defensiveness. I’m shifting my portfolio to focus heavily on sectors that are historically known for their stability—think consumer staples and utility companies. My investment thesis is centered around selecting undervalued movers, as this approach not only protects against speculative volatility but also positions us favorably should the market environment shift again.

I’m reducing my exposure to high-growth sectors that might be more susceptible to swings caused by macro uncertainties. Instead, I’m favoring those resilient names, as they tend to maintain their value even when the broader market faces turbulence.

Let’s navigate these twists and turns together, keeping our focus on quality and long-term stability to build a sound investment in your portfolio!

## Market Regime
Good morning! As we step into December 2025, I'm feeling a strong risk-on sentiment in the market. The recent movement of key indicators suggests that growth-oriented stocks are ready to shine again, especially with our indicators showing significant velocity. This is a welcoming sign for investors who are looking to capitalize on some upward trends after a period of cautious decision-making.

## Macro Drivers
The current macro landscape is quite intriguing. The VIX, often dubbed the 'fear gauge', is showing signs of retreat, indicating that market anxiety is easing. This positivity has pushed me to increase allocations towards growth-oriented assets. Additionally, Bitcoin prices are doing a little dance up the scale, which traditionally sparks a more risk-on attitude among investors. 

On the flip side, oil prices are wavering downwards, adding a bit of caution, but the impact is relatively mild. This gives me the space to remain favorably inclined toward investments that can leverage growth and momentum. Our first principal component analysis (PCA) factors also show a mixed bag, with some lifting the outlook while others are slightly dampening it. Overall, though, it seems like the positivity from Bitcoin and the VIX's passage into calmer waters proactive influences my rotating decisions!

## Strategy Outlook
Today, I’m heavily favoring growth and momentum plays. My analysis suggests focusing on undervalued yet high-potential companies that provide a solid valuation guardrail against speculative pitfalls in the broader market. I’m particularly looking for stocks with high velocity and positive macro sentiment. Companies positioned to benefit from tech advancements and innovative services are certainly catching my eye. 

As for quality, I’m still keeping a watchful eye on quality plays that have strong fundamentals — these will act as my safe havens should the winds change course again. While there’s still some caution in oil-related sectors, I'm keeping part of my strategy dynamic to transition toward investments that can truly capitalize on this risk-on mood. Let's keep our eyes peeled and make smart moves as we close out the year! Happy investing!
